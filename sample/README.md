The sample app demonstrates the SD-card file chooser in action. No configuration is necessary for that.

If you want to try the Dropbox part of the sample, you'll need to get your own
API-keys at [https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps)
and insert them into DropboxSyncHelper.java and AndroidManifest.xml. See Dropbox for more details
on that.

The dropbox sample uses the Core API. If you want to use the Sync API, have look at:

https://github.com/spacecowboy/NotePad/tree/master/core/src/com/nononsenseapps/filepicker

for an example of that.
