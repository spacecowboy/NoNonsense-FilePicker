- Extendable for other sources
- Can select multiple items
- Directories or files
- Create directory in the picker


** Yet another file picker library?

I needed a file picker that had two primary properties:

1. Easy to extend: I needed a file picker that would work for normal
   files on the SD-card, and also for using the Dropbox Sync API.
2. Able to create a directory in the picker.

This project has both of those qualities. As a bonus, it also scales
nicely to work on any phone or tablet. The core is placed in abstract
classes so it is easy and clear how to extend the picker to create
your own.

The library includes an implementation that allows the user to pick
files from the SD-card. But the picker could easily be extended to get
it's file listings from another source, such as Dropbox, FTP, SSH and
so on.

By inheriting from an Activity, the picker is able to be rendered as
full screen on small screens and as a dialog on large screens. It does
this through the theme system, so it is very important for the
activity to use the correct theme.

** How to include in your project (from MavenCentral)

Coming in a day or so.

** How to include in your project (from source)
#+begin_src sh
cd MyProjectRoot
git clone https://github.com/spacecowboy/NoNonsense-FilePicker.git
echo "include ':NoNonsense-FilePicker:library'" >> settings.gradle
#+end_src

Then in your /build.gradle/ add this line in the dependency section:

#+begin_src groovy
compile project(':NoNonsense-FilePicker:library')
#+end_src

Have a look at the sample app for detailed usage, short instructions
for the included file picker:

***  Include permission in your manifest
#+begin_src xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
#+end_src

*** Include the file picker picker activity
You must *set the theme* on the activity. You can subclass it to
customize but it is required. The intent filter is optional
depending on your use case.

#+begin_src xml
<activity
   android:name="com.nononsenseapps.filepicker.FilePickerActivity"
   android:label="@string/app_name"
   android:theme="@style/FilePicker.Theme">
   <intent-filter>
      <action android:name="android.intent.action.GET_CONTENT" />
      <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
   </intent-filter>
</activity>
#+end_src

*** Starting the picker in your app

#+begin_src java
// This always works
Intent i = new Intent(NoNonsenseFilePicker.this, FilePickerActivity.class);
// This works if you defined the intent filter
// Intent i = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT);

// Set these depending on your use case. These are the defaults.
i.putExtra(FilePickerActivity.EXTRA_ALLOW_MULTIPLE, false);
i.putExtra(FilePickerActivity.EXTRA_ALLOW_CREATE_DIR, false);
i.putExtra(FilePickerActivity.EXTRA_MODE, FilePickerActivity.MODE_FILE);

startActivityForResult(i, FILE_CODE);
#+end_src

*** Handling the result
If you have a minimum requirement of Jelly Bean (API 16) and above,
you can skip the second method.

#+begin_src java
@TargetApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN)
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    if (requestCode == FILE_CODE && resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
        if (data.getBooleanExtra(FilePickerActivity.EXTRA_ALLOW_MULTIPLE, false)) {
            // For JellyBean and above
            if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN) {
                ClipData clip = data.getClipData();

                if (clip != null) {
                    for (int i = 0; i < clip.getItemCount(); i++) {
                        Uri uri = clip.getItemAt(i).getUri();
                        // Do something with the URI
                    }
                }
            // For Ice Cream Sandwich
            } else {
                ArrayList<String> paths = data.getStringArrayListExtra
                            (FilePickerActivity.EXTRA_PATHS);

                if (paths != null) {
                    for (String path: paths) {
                        Uri uri = Uri.parse(path);
                        // Do something with the URI
                    }
                }
            }

        } else {
            Uri uri = data.getData();
            // Do something with the URI
        }
    }
}
